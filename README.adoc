= rust-cgi

Easily create CGIfootnote:[Retro!]footnote:[Common Gateway Interface 1.1, RFC
3875] programmesfootnote:[Yes, I'm spelling it programme, the correct way.] in
Rust based on link:https://github.com/hyperium/http[`http` types].

= Installation & Usage

`Cargo.toml`:

[code,toml]
----
[dependencies]
cgi = { git = "https://github.com/mocsy/rust-cgi" }
----

In the `main` function, call only `cgi::handle(...)`, with a function that
takes a `cgi::Request` and returns `cgi::Response`.

[code,rust]
----
extern crate cgi;

fn main() { cgi::handle(|request: cgi::Request| -> cgi::Response {
    ...
})}
----

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program[Hello World]:

[code,rust]
----
extern crate cgi;

fn main() { cgi::handle(|request: cgi::Request| -> cgi::Response {
    cgi::string_response(200, "<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>")
})}
----

It will parse & extract the CGI environmental variables, and HTTP request body
to create `Request`, and convert your `Response` into the correct format and
print to stdout. If this programme is not called as CGI (e.g. missing required
environmental variables), it will panic.

== Response Shortcuts

Several shortcuts create shortcuts easily:

`cgi:empty_response(status_code)`:: A HTTP Reponse with no body and that HTTP
status code, e.g. `return cgi::empty_response(404);` to return a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404[HTTP 404 Not Found].
`cgi::string_response(status_code, text)`:: Converts `text` to bytes (UTF8),
and sends that as the body with that `status_code`, e.g. `return
cgi::string_response(200, "Hello World!");` returns a simple plain text
response.
`cgi::binary_response(status_code, blob)`:: Sends  `blob` with that status code.

== Re-exports

`http` is re-exported, (as `cgi::http`).

`cgi::Response`/`Request` are `http::Response<Vec<u8>>`/`Request<Vec<u8>>`.

= Running locally

Python provides a simple CGI webserver. The binaries must be in a `cgi-bin`
directory. Run this in your project root directory (i.e. where `Cargo.toml`
is), and open link:http://localhost:8000/[].

----
ln -s ./target/debug/ ./cgi-bin/
python2 -m CGIHTTPServer

= Why?

CGI is old, and easy to deploy. Just drop a binary in the right place, and
Apache (or whatever) will serve it up. Rust is fast, so for simple things,
there should be less downsides to spinning up a custom HTTP server.
